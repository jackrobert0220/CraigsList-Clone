# Project-Two

- OurList is a an endeavor to reverse engineer the popular classified-ads website, CraigsList. 
 
	Some of the basic features of the site include posting an item for sale, along with its price and description. Items will be placed within a category according to its context.
 
	Each listing will feature full CRUD abilities. Users can add a new one, edit or delete and existing one and add comments to whichever one they chose.

  First, User Stories and User Data Flow was setup to establish how the site will function once completed. Then a mockup wireframes were drawn up as a visual guide for how these functions were going to be accessed. 
  
* VISUAL AIDS ARE ALL INCLUDED IN THE 'WIREFRAMES' FOLDER OF THIS PROJECT*

   The server.js was coded, along with the .gitignore file to set the basic structure of our stack-to-be. All dependencies were then installed along with building the config folder to establish deployment with Heroku and MongoDB.

   The views for the Gigs category were written up to be our visual guide for coding the back-end functionality. Once this category was fully operational, then the rest of the categories would be created with ease.

   The models , routes and controller functions were built for Gigs. Full CRUD functionality was achieved with this particular category. User is able to create a new listing, along with being able to edit/delete it and add comments to it along with time stamps.

   The categories Furniture, Electronics  and Books were then added and all bugs were worked out.

   Partials were then implemented along with the CSS for the page. We wanted to capture the simplicity of the original site, but wanted to give it a touch of “flare” it was definitely lacking.
